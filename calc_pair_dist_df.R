#' Calculate the distance between a pair of snps and return dataframe

#' @description
#' The distance between the snps is given by the norm of the difference
#' between their co-ordinates. With the co-ordinates being the corresponding
#' rows in the "score_mat". The type of norm used given by the "norm_typ".
#' NaNs are ignored so snps are only compared on common axis.
#' The output dataframe "dist_df" is 1 row with
#'   * "snp1" the name of the first snp
#'   * "snp2" the name of the second snp
#'   * "dist" the distance between the snps.
