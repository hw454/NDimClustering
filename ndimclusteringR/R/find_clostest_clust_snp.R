#' Find the cluster whose centroid is closest to snp_id
#'
#' @description
#'   Find the distance between the snp and each cluster centroid.
#'   If the distance is less then the currently assigned cluster then
#'   reassign the cluster number and cluster distance.
#'
#' @param snp_id the label for the snp
#' @param b_mat the matrix of the data. The rows correpond to the snps.
#' @param cluster_df dataframe of cluster membership. Each row is a snp,
#'   it has columns for\:
#'    * "clust_num" the number of the allocated cluster.
#'    * "clust_dist" the distane to the centre of the cluster.
#'    * "clust_prob" probability the snp is in the assigned cluster.
#' @param centroids_df dataframe of the centroid co-ordinates. Each row
#'   corresponds to a cluster number and the columns are the trait axes.
#' @param norm_typ The type of norm to be used to calculate distance. The
#'    default is the Froebenius norm "F".
#' @param max_dist The maximum distance between any two points. Used
#'   for initialisation if snp is not already in the cluster assignment.
#'
#' @details
#'   The dataframe "snp_clust_df"  has a row labelled by the "snp_id".
#'   The columns are\:
#'   * "clust_num" The number of the closest cluster
#'   * "clust_dist" The distance from the snp to the centroid of that cluster.
#'   * "clust_prob" probability the snp is in the cluster it's been assigned.
#'   The dataframe "snp_clust_dist_df"  has a row labelled by the "snp_id".
#'   The columns are the clust numbers, each value is the distance from the
#'   snp to that cluster.
